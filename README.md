# Tromino-Tile

This is a simple example of a program that uses the [htdp-image](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/htdp-image) library.

The [Tromino Tiling problem ](http://www.itu.dk/~carsten/courses/f02/assignments/hw5/hw5.html) is commonly introduced to
students learning induction. An interesting fact about the problem is that its proof also gives us a program for
solving an instance of the tromino tiling problem. This program demonstrate an example solution where the solution mimics
the logic behind the inductive proof, but without worrying about the graphics side of the program at all!
